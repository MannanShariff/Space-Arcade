## 🧪 Code Style & Guidelines

- Use clear variable and function names.  
- Keep logic modular: if adding new entities (e.g. enemy types), create a separate class if needed.  
- Avoid large monolithic functions.  
- Prefer vanilla JavaScript (no libraries unless discussed).  
- Comment complex logic.

- New enemy types or behaviors (e.g. shooters, zig-zag movement)  
- Sound effects and music  
- Game settings (difficulty levels, volume controls)
